# wingspan

A Next.js application for collecting birds

## About

This is for the week 5 project of the FAC software developer apprenticeship. A Nextjs full-stack application. Ours is inspired by the game [wingspan](https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/).

## Design

Wireframes were done using figma, and you can see them [here](https://www.figma.com/file/iiODlCs5mHMrSqUgyhGMW3/Homepage?type=design).
